"""The `full` profile — maximum-realism, heavy, nightly/manual only.

Test book: *Moby-Dick* by Herman Melville (public domain). Validated live.

  * **Real Chrome solves Cloudflare, end to end (VERIFIED).** AA search/detail are
    reachable (mock-aa), but the AA *slow-download* links point through the
    Cloudflare gate (mock-cf). Downloading therefore forces the in-image headless
    Chromium (seleniumbase CDP internal bypasser) to execute the challenge JS,
    harvest ``cf_clearance``, and fetch the gated slow-download page. Moby-Dick
    landing in ``/books`` is only possible if Chrome actually solved the gate —
    that is the literal "spin a chrome browser" path.
  * **DoH** enabled at boot (``USE_DOH=true``) without breaking startup.

The real torrent-client download (the other half of the `full` profile) lives in
test_cluster_clients.py, which runs under `full` and the `client-*` profiles.
Only runs under the ``full`` profile booted by ``run-e2e.sh env/full.env``.
